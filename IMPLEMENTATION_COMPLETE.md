```

**Cancellation available at steps 1-2 only**

```bash
cd D:\SMARTSHOPAI\capstone1_SMPC_store\backend
node scripts/migrate_orders.js
```

**Expected output**: 
- "✅ Successfully migrated: X"
- "🎉 Migration completed successfully!"

### 2. Restart Backend Server
```bash
node src/index.js
```

### 3. Test the System

**Quick Test:**
1. Make a test purchase (complete PayOS payment)
2. Visit: http://localhost:4000/pages/seller_orders.html
3. Click "Accept Order"
4. Click "Mark as Delivered"
5. Visit: http://localhost:4000/pages/buyer_orders.html

## 🔒 What's Been Protected

✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing PayOS payment flow works exactly as before
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Old orders work after migration
✅ **Authorization**: Users can only modify their own orders
✅ **Status Validation**: Invalid transitions are blocked
✅ **Audit Trail**: All status changes are logged with timestamps

---

## ❌ What's NOT Included (As Requested)

- ❌ Refund system (skipped per your request)
- ❌ Tracking numbers (simplified flow)
- ❌ Auto-delivery confirmation (manual only)
- ❌ Email/SMS notifications (can add later)
- ❌ Review system (explicitly excluded)

---

## 🎯 Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Simplified Flow**: paid → processing → delivered → completed
   - Skipped "shipped" status per your request
   - Tracking number optional (not required)

2. **Status Field**: 
   - Old: `status` (removed by migration)
   - New: `orderStatus` (consistent naming)

3. **Cancellation Rules**:
   - Buyer: Can cancel when `paid` only
   - Seller: Can cancel when `paid` or `processing`
   - Neither can cancel after `delivered`

4. **Manual Confirmation**: Buyer must manually confirm delivery
   - No auto-confirmation after X days
   - Keeps control with buyer

## ✅ Final Checklist
